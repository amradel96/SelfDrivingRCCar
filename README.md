# SelfDrivingRCCar
This Project aims to equip standard remote control (RC) car with improved control since commonly used (RC) car control joystick is replaced with certain controlling system based on camera.  This project also aims to learn how to integrate between mechanical, electronics and vision so that we are able to integrate what we have learned in our machine vision course with our core as a mechatronics engineer but in this project we focused on how to control our car by vision as this our main target. The camera that is attached to car enables view from perspective of (RC) car. (RC) car can be used in many applications such as scouting. Our car is controlled by getting arrows direction as input from our camera.
